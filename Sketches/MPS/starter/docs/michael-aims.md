# Aim

* To test the use of ECS in C++ in Physics with early career researchers
    * This means “if it goes well, why did it go well?”
    * This means “if it goes not so well, why?”
    * And what does well mean?
    * Hopefully should go well, lead to highly parallisable code (without pain or too much pain)
* Gives you experience of
    * Simulation in a domain of your choice
    * Publishing your research of testing ECS in that domain
    * Good software engineering practice (hopefully)
Publish experience report
Bonus:
Publish use of ECS in your domain of physics at least to Zenodo and arXiv
