/*
There seems to be a problem where if you uncomment this code and then try make dockerbuild,
there is confusion because there are no two main() functions (one here and one in main.cpp).

Not sure what to do about that.

/* 
DO NOT BUILD USING VSCODE !!!!!!!!!!


#include <iostream>
#include <flecs.h>
#include <systems.h>

int main() 
{
    std::cout<<"Hello World"<<std::endl; 
}
