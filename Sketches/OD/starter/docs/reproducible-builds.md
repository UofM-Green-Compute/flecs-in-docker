# Aim

Build environments must be consistent across development projects - so that
a developer can know how to work on the project and build it without special
knowledge.

## Started

[ ] Work has started on capturing the project build process
[ ] The team has started capturing a list of code dependencies

## First results

[ ] The team has a well described build process
[ ] The team has a well described list of code dependencies
[ ] The team has started exploring the use of containerisation for building code
[ ] The team has started exploring the use of containerisation for pinning code depenedencies

## Mature

[ ] The project can be checked out and development container built in a uniform way
[ ] The dependencies can be pulled in or built by the container is a uniform way
[ ] The code that depends upon the dependencies can be built using the same container
