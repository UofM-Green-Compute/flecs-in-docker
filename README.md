This docker repo was designed initially for use with C++20 coroutines and
various other tests. It's being repurposed as a build environment that
abstracts away the flecs dependencies.



Old notes:

Despite appearances, this directory is not actually about docker. It's about
using docker to test the availability of C++20 formats in g++ in current versions
of ubuntu.
