# Aim
* Get a working a working fluid simulation
  - Produce some visual components such as videos and graphs
* Get a good grade
* Understanding of how to make computing greener
* Final product that is useful for an actual researcher
  - Including an explanation document 

## Checkpoints:

  ## Week 8 
  [] Submit optional draft report outline (20th Nov)

  ## Week 11
  [] Report deadline (18th Dec)
  [] Last day of project work
  [] Lab book assessment period 9th - 18th Dec

  ## January Exam Season - Interview period

## Progress 
  ## Started
  [x] Set up build environment on personal computer
  [x] Decided on starter project to get familiar with flecs
  [x] Decided on direction for main project simulation

  ## First results
  [x] Produced starter project - coupled oscilator system 
      [x] Working calcualtions for coupled oscillator system implemented using ECS
      [x] Successfully write data to a file
      [x] Read data from file and animate in python

  ## Up Next
  [] Deadline Week 7: Complete a simple fluid simulation and produce result (e.g graph)

  ## Further down the line
  [] Animation of fluid process 
  [] Simulate flow past a circle
  [] Include viscosity in flow past a circle 

  ## ....any further steps
